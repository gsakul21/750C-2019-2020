# 750C-2019-2020

This repository contains the programs from various competitons of the 2019-2020 year for Team 750C of South Brunswick High School. The programs saved within this repository consist of the various iterations I went through to develop the systems and fuctions of our robot as we progressed through the year. These include autonomous functionality, a selector for various situations and start positions within the game, and fine tuned controls with hot keys to suit our driver's needs.
